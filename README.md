The Windows Registry is a [hierarchical database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_database_model) that stores [low-level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-_and_low-level) settings for the Microsoft Windows operating system and for applications that opt to use the registry. The [kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(operating_system)), [device drivers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_driver), [services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_service), [Security Accounts Manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Account_Manager), and [user interfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface) can all use the registry. The registry also allows access to [counters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumentation_(computer_programming)) for profiling system performance.

In other words, the registry or Windows Registry contains information, settings, options, and other values for programs and hardware installed on all versions of Microsoft Windows operating systems. For example, when a program is installed, a new subkey containing settings such as a program's location, its version, and how to start the program, are all added to the Windows Registry.

# Structure of Registry Key:
The registry contains two basic elements: keys and values. Registry keys are container objects similar to folders. Registry values are non-container objects similar to files. Keys may contain values and subkeys. Keys are referenced with a syntax similar to Windows' path names, using backslashes to indicate levels of hierarchy. Keys must have a [case insensitive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_sensitivity) name without backslashes.

The hierarchy of registry keys can only be accessed from a known root key handle (which is anonymous but whose effective value is a constant numeric handle) that is mapped to the content of a registry key preloaded by the kernel from a stored "hive", or to the content of a subkey within another root key, or mapped to a registered service or DLL that provides access to its contained subkeys and values.
